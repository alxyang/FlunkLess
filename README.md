# FlunkLess

## An environment to boost collaboration in academia.
<ul>
<li>As a student, you may have experienced frustration in finding a suitable group partner for assignments, or even partners to study with inside your class.</li>
<li>Networks like Facebook are inherently unsuited for this type of collaboration because you simply are not yet connected with the majority of the class body in most cases.</li>
<li>Furthermore, on the rare occasions when Facebook groups are made for classes, they are usually student created and therefore a significant portion may not even be aware that this group exists.</li>
</ul>

FlunkLess is a real-time chat application which aims to solve these problems.
